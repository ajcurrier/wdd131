".classList Method","### `classList` Property
**Term**: `classList` Property  
**Definition**: The `classList` property is a read-only property in JavaScript that provides access to the list of classes assigned to an HTML element. It allows you to easily add.. remove.. toggle.. and check for the presence of CSS classes on an element.. making it useful for dynamic styling and behavior control. It includes methods such as `.add()`.. `.remove()`.. `.toggle()`.. and `.contains()`.  
**Example**:
```javascript
const menu = document.getElementById('menu');

// Toggle the 'active' class on the menu element
menu.classList.toggle('active');
```
In this example.. the `toggle` method adds the `active` class if it is not present and removes it if it is already there.. making it useful for interactive elements like menus or buttons.","JavaScript","0","0"
".toggle Method","### `toggle` Method
**Term**: `toggle` Method  
**Definition**: The `toggle` method is a function available on the `classList` property in JavaScript.

It effectively switches the class on and off.. making it ideal for toggling the visibility or state of an element based on user interaction. It can optionally take a second boolean argument to force-add or force-remove the class.  
**Example**:
```javascript
const menu = document.getElementById('menu');

// Toggle the 'active' class on the menu element
menu.classList.toggle('active');

Common arguments include numbers (`:nth-child(2)` selects the second child).. keywords like `odd` or `even`.. and formulas like `2n+1` to select every odd element.  
**Example**:
```css
li:nth-child(2) {
    color: red; /* Selects the second <li> element */
}

li:nth-child(odd) {
    background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Selects all odd <li> elements */
}
