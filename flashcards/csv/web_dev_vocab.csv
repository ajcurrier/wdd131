How to use :hover,"""To apply styles using the :hover pseudo-class, you directly attach it to the element selector without spaces. For example, to change the background color and text color of a link with the class .menu-tags on hover, you use the syntax .menu-tags:hover { background-color: #b0c4b1; color: black; }. Incorrect usage, such as including a space between the element and the :hover, will prevent the styles from being applied correctly.""",CSS
Center Text Horizontally,"""commonly achieved using the text-align property. This property can be applied to a parent container to align its child elements' text content. To center text, use text-align: center; on the parent element containing the text.""",CSS

auto-fitting columns,"""This layout automatically adjusts to screen size, adding or removing columns based on the space available, while ensuring each column is at least 150px wide.
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr));
    grid-gap: 15px;
}""",CSS
create a Border,"""border: width style color;""",CSS
Round Border corners,"""border-radius: 5px;""",CSS
CSS Transition Property,"""The transition property in CSS is used to animate changes in property values over a specified duration, creating smooth transitions between different states of an element. It is typically used to enhance the user experience by animating properties such as colors, sizes, and positions when the state of an element changes due to interactions like hover or focus.
Example:
button {
    background-color: blue;
    transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: green;
}""",CSS
console.log() Method,"""The console.log() method is a built-in function in JavaScript used to print output to the browser’s console. It is commonly used for debugging purposes, allowing developers to log messages, variable values, or any other information to help track the flow of execution or identify issues in the code.
Example:

const name = 'Alice';
console.log('Hello, ' + name); // Outputs: Hello, Alice
In this example, the console.log() method prints the message Hello, Alice to the console. It is an essential tool for troubleshooting and understanding code behavior during development.""",JavaScript
.classList Method,"""### `classList` Property
**Term**: `classList` Property  
**Definition**: The `classList` property is a read-only property in JavaScript that provides access to the list of classes assigned to an HTML element. It allows you to easily add, remove, toggle, and check for the presence of CSS classes on an element, making it useful for dynamic styling and behavior control. It includes methods such as `.add()`, `.remove()`, `.toggle()`, and `.contains()`.  
**Example**:
```javascript
const menu = document.getElementById('menu');

// Toggle the 'active' class on the menu element
menu.classList.toggle('active');
```
In this example, the `toggle` method adds the `active` class if it is not present and removes it if it is already there, making it useful for interactive elements like menus or buttons.""",JavaScript
.toggle Method,"""### `toggle` Method
**Term**: `toggle` Method  
**Definition**: The `toggle` method is a function available on the `classList` property in JavaScript. It is used to add a specified class to an element if it is not already present, and to remove the class if it is present. It effectively switches the class on and off, making it ideal for toggling the visibility or state of an element based on user interaction. It can optionally take a second boolean argument to force-add or force-remove the class.  
**Example**:
```javascript
const menu = document.getElementById('menu');

// Toggle the 'active' class on the menu element
menu.classList.toggle('active');
```
In this example, the `toggle` method adds the `active` class if it is not present and removes it if it is already there, providing a simple way to create interactive behavior.""",JavaScript
:nth-child(),":nth-child()` Pseudo-Class
**Term**: `:nth-child()` Pseudo-Class  
**Definition**: The `:nth-child()` pseudo-class in CSS is used to select one or more elements based on their position within a parent element. It takes a single argument, which can be a number, keyword, or formula, to target elements in a pattern. Common arguments include numbers (`:nth-child(2)` selects the second child), keywords like `odd` or `even`, and formulas like `2n+1` to select every odd element.  
**Example**:
```css
li:nth-child(2) {
    color: red; /* Selects the second <li> element */
}

li:nth-child(odd) {
    background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Selects all odd <li> elements */
}
```
In these examples, the `nth-child(2)` targets the second `li` element, and `nth-child(odd)` targets all odd-numbered `li` elements, applying the specified styles to them.""",JavaScript
The addEventListener() method steps,"""The first parameter is the type of the event (like click or mousedown or any other HTML DOM Event.)

The second parameter is the function we want to call when the event occurs.

The third parameter is a boolean value specifying whether to use event bubbling or event capturing. This parameter is optional.

Note that you don't use the 'on' prefix for the event; use 'click instead of onclick""
",JavaScript
addEventListener definition,A method that attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers. It allows an element to respond to multiple events.,JavaScript
document.querySelector(),"A method that returns the first element within the document that matches the specified CSS selector(s). If no matches are found, it returns null.",JavaScript
