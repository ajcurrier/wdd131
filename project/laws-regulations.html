            <h1>Provo Bicycling Laws</h1>

            <div id="lawsContainer">
     
                <h2>Legal Requirements for Bicycle Lighting</h2>

                <p class='body-copy'>In Provo, cyclists are legally required to equip their
                bicycles with lights after dark. According to local laws, a white front light
                and a red rear light or reflector must be visible at specific distances to
                enhance safety for both the rider and other road users.*</p>



                <h2>Riding on Sidewalks</h2>
                <p class='body-copy'>While riding on sidewalks in Provo is allowed, local
                regulations prohibit bicycle use on sidewalks along certain busy streets, such
                as contiguous to University Avenue in designated areas. Cyclists must yield to
                pedestrians and follow posted signals when riding in these zones.*</p>

                <h2>Safety Concerns for Pedal Cycling</h2>
                <p class='body-copy'>Safety is a priority in Provo. Despite being a
                bicycle-friendly city, cyclists should remain vigilant and aware of their
                surroundings. In recent years, bicycle accidents have occurred, so adhering to
                rules and regulations is crucial for a safe cycling experience.*</p>

                
                <h2>Designated Bicycle Lanes</h2>
                <p class='body-copy'>Provo has established numerous designated bike lanes
                throughout the city to ensure safe travel for cyclists. Noteworthy bike lanes
                include the Murdock Canal Trail, Provo River Parkway, and Lakeview Parkway
                Trail, among others. These lanes allow cyclists to navigate the city comfortably and securely.*</p>


                
                <h2>Helmet Requirements</h2>
                <p class='body-copy'>While Provo does not have a statewide helmet requirement for
                cyclists of any age, wearing a helmet is highly recommended for safety. Helmets
                can greatly reduce the risk of serious head injuries in the event of accidents.*</p>
